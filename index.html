                        <p>Here we will go with Tufferfish to allow for easier waveclear. Once you become more comfortable, I'd suggeset taking Slime Time</p>

                        <p>Fish Tank is a must have! With no bribe stacks, this allows you to easily solo mercenary camps</p>

                        <p>Making Inky is flat out oppressive. 2 second cd on Slime is a great way to deal constant damage, as well as constantly heal yourself in teamfights</p>

                        <p>Don't forget to place your egg!</p>
                        <p>Unlike normal heroes, murky has a SUPER short respawn time, and his deaths only count toward 25% of a kill!</p>
                        <p>Once dead, murky will take about 6 seconds to hatch from his egg, so be sure to place it in a safe spot close to your lane!</p>

                        <p>utilizing the pufferfish to get killing blows on minions is essential for getting bribe stacks!</p>
                        <p>Try to utilize the Q > wait 1 second > W > then Q. With this, the minions should be weakened enough to take the killing blow from pufferfish.</p>
                        <p>Note that once you are level 4, one Q and one W will kill the entire wave of minions</p>

                        <p>This is a mercenary camp. If you can defeat them, they will become temporary allies and help destroy enemy towers!</p>
                        <p>With the level 1 talent 'A Fishy Deal', we can bribe these mercenaries to join us without having to take the time to defeat them</p>
                        <p>Murky can be especially useful for bribing mercs on the enemy side of the map</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Get to the objective ahead of time to drop your egg in a sneaky spot!</p>
                        <p>It's very important to ensure it's hidden so the enemy team doesn't destroy it</p>
                        <p>Good egg placement can help get you back into the fight quickly</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Slime(<b>Q</b>) an enemy and quickly drop the pufferfish(<b>W</b>)</p>
                        <p>Follow this up with an Octograb(<b>R</b>)</p>
                        <p>having a few teammates around to assist in finishing off the kill is essential! Try not to do this alone!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Use your Slime(<b>Q</b>) and Safety Bubble(<b>E</b>) to be as annoying as possible during the teamfight</p>
                        <p>Using the slow from your slime and big area of the pufferfish can be useful to help teammates chase down or escape from enemies</p>
                        <p>If the teamfight lasts long enough, you may be able to Octograb(<b>R</b>) again since it has a very short cooldown!</p>
                        <p>Look to finish off enemies, and keep them off the objective. It's okay to die a few times as Murky if you have your egg nearby :D</p>
